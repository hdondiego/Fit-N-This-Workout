# Fit-N-This-Workout
An Android application used to help users log their workouts.

The Fit-N-This Workout application was written on Spring 2019.
Unfortunately, in its current state, it does need improvement.

The last time it was written, I still needed to include a feature where the user can enter the weight used and the repetitions done with that weight (if weight was used).
In addition, an issue needs to be resolved (it seems to be correlated with the previous issue) where all the workouts are cleared (for the user). By speculation, the error causes the
user to be signed out.
